- Shoddy cockpit model
- Literally no idea what any of those controls are meant to be.
- Are they guages filled with some weird fluid?
- Could be?
- Where does it go?
- IDK, I'm not Mr Spaceship.
- Had some spaces to fill with shaders, filled them with shaders.
- I even have [Kit Ops](https://www.kit-ops.com/) installed but didnt bother.
- Click the bottom left thing and you can do a little spin reveal.

***

- Lots of R3F and drei
- Like way too much of the work here is just done by importing stuff.
- Didn't do the stars, didn't do the camera shake etc.
- Actually if I start listing things I didnt do in sketches it'll take way too long.

***

- The buttons press that actually gets lost in the caera shake is react-springs.
- Sticking that label on that button was done with a helper but was such a pain that I count that as a me achievement. 
- The fact that you can move a liitle bit but not spin is to do with the actual physics of my ship design.
- It is in no way because i had an issue with getting things to update properly to make a spin work. 


***

- Updating this way too soon before I've got to go get a bus so like 50% chance I broke everything.
